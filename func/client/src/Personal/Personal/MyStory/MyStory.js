        </div>
        <p className="mt-8">
          Growing up in Shillong was a memorable experience for me. As a child,
          I was always fascinated by the beauty of nature surrounding me in the
          picturesque hill station. I spent countless hours exploring the
          forests, hills, and rivers, which nurtured my love for nature and made
          me appreciate its magnificence.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-5">
          My interests in health, physics, and maths developed as I grew up. I
          spent a lot of time reading books on these subjects, and my curiosity
          led me to explore the world around me with a scientific perspective. I
          remember spending hours conducting experiments and observing
          phenomena, which helped me develop a keen analytical mind and a love
          for problem-solving.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-5">
          Growing up in Shillong was not without its hardships. The region faced
          many challenges, including political unrest, economic difficulties,
          and social issues. However, these difficulties also taught me valuable
          life lessons, including the importance of resilience, determination,
          and perseverance. I learned to adapt to changing circumstances, find
          solutions to problems, and appreciate the little things in life.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-5">
          The financial difficulties we faced as a family were challenging, but
          they also taught me essential life lessons. I learned to be grateful
          for what I had, to be resourceful and creative in finding solutions to
          problems, and to work hard to achieve my dreams despite the obstacles
          in my path.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-5">
          Looking back on my growing-up days in Shillong, I am grateful for the
          experiences that shaped me into who I am today. My love for nature,
          passion for learning, and ability to overcome challenges testify to
          the lessons I learned during my formative years in this beautiful hill
          station.
